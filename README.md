# sd-movie-recommendation-system
Hey there! I have made an end-to-end project of content based movie recommendation system using the tmdb dataset of 5000 movies using python, which will recommend you 5 movies related to the movie which you have selected. Also, I have used a python library Streamlit to develop the UI for this web application. I have used Heroku for the deployment of this project
The python libraries used in this project are: Pandas, Numpy, Ast, NLTK, Sklearn, Pickle, Streamlit, Requests
